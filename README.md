KDE - Group Assignment - Group 2


#Directions

> Open ontolology.rdf in Protege to see the current ontology. Use this to run the query from github as well

<b>Classes:</b> we have 11+ now but may need to check that our implementation is correct

<b>Properties:</b>  can view these in protege under annotation properties (I think these count towards our 10 properties for the assignment)



All the data files were currently using are already in ontology.ttl and in the data files folder

Most of our CSO data came from:

http://data.cso.ie/datasets/persons-by-type-of-accommodation.html


##Data files were using:

> Counties.ttl - cso counties and notations eg. C01 is ‘Carlow’

> House-types.ttl - ontology for house types (found under dimensions of the dataset on cso link above)

> Property-type-by-county.ttl - number of accomodations by type by county 

> Persons by type of accommodation per county - number of persons by type of accommodation per county 

> Geohives-counties.ttl- geohive data, counties and coordinates
